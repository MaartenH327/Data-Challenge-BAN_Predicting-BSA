Welcome to the GitHub repository for our BSA prediction project. This thesis project on predicting BSA outcomes is a collaborative effort by a group of BSc Business
Analytics students at the University of Amsterdam. The group consists of Maarten Hoogeboom, Yassin Abdellatif, and Roel Lust, each contributing individually to the research objective while focusing on specific sub-objectives. Each team member has written an individual thesis centered on the respective sub-objectives
